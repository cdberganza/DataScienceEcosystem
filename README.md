# DataScienceEcosystem
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook created as part of the final project of the course "IBM tools for Data Science".

Greetings to all my classmates in the course, especially to whoever is going to grade my work.

I say hello to my future self, this remains as evidence of my first repository on GitHub.
